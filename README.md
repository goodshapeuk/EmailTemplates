### Repository Notes
A email-signature template repository for Set-OutlookSignatures script, executed via Intune registered clients, running as the logged in user.

This repository exists as a verification point, for our own staff to see template changes in our own outlook account, before cloning those changes to customer github organisation repositories.

### Release Process
A formal release process is required, for the Intune Remediation script to adequately check the current release ZIP vs the downloaded release ZIP, saving on bandwidth and unncessary processing locally.
